##  Inventory File 

Ansible inventory file is a fundamental component of Ansible that defines the hosts (remote systems) that you want to manage and the groups those hosts belong to. The inventory file can be static (a simple text file) or dynamic (generated by a script). It provides Ansible with the information about the remote nodes to communicate with during its operations.

### Static Inventory
A static inventory file is typically a plain text file (usually named hosts or inventory) and is structured in INI or YAML format. Here are examples of both formats:

```
[myhosts]
ubuntu@IPADDRESS
```
